# Choosing Instrumentation Tool for Observability
- Status: accepted
- Deciders: @hansen1904
- Date: 2024-12-13

## Context and Problem Statement
To ensure comprehensive observability for our applications, we need to select an appropriate instrumentation tool. The tool should be capable of collecting traces, metrics, and logs from our applications, providing detailed insights into their performance and behavior. This decision is crucial as it will impact our ability to monitor, debug, and optimize our applications.

## Decision Drivers
- Comprehensive Data Collection: The tool must support the collection of traces, metrics, and logs.
- Ease of Integration: The tool should integrate seamlessly with our existing Go and React applications.
- Community and Support: Strong community support and documentation to aid in implementation and troubleshooting.
- Scalability: The tool should be able to scale with the growth of our applications and traffic.
- Standardization: Support for industry standards to ensure compatibility with other observability tools and platforms.

## Considered Options
- Opentelemetry
- Prometheus
- Jaeger

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: OpenTelemetry, because it provides a unified approach to collecting traces, metrics, and logs, and integrates well with various backend solutions.

### Positive Consequences
- Unified Instrumentation: OpenTelemetry supports traces, metrics, and logs, providing a single point of instrumentation.
- Ease of Integration: Seamless integration with Go and React applications through well-documented libraries and SDKs.
- Strong Community Support: Backed by a strong community and industry leaders, ensuring ongoing support and improvements.
- Standardization: Adheres to industry standards, ensuring compatibility with other observability tools and platforms.
- Flexibility: Can be used with various backends like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and more.

### Negative Consequences
- Learning Curve: There may be a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with OpenTelemetry.
- Initial Setup: Initial setup and configuration might be complex and time-consuming.
