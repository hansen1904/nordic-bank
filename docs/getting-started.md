## Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Git installed
- [Optional] Postman installed

## Installation
To run Nordic Bank locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository through your terminal:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hansen1904/nordic-bank.git
```

2. Run the command below:
```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```

Now everything should be up and running locally.

## Observability

After running the `docker-compose up -d` command, you should be able to go to:
- Jaeger instance at [http://localhost:16686/](http://localhost:16686/) to see traces.
- Prometheus instance at [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/) to see metrics.
- Grafana instance at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to visualize metrics (default username is 'admin' and password is 'admin').

## Database

To see what is saved inside the database, go to the PGAdmin instance at [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/), where the username is 'admin@admin.com' and the password is 'admin'.

If this is your first time going there, you should set up a connection to the database.

### Setup Connection to Database

1. Right-click on "Servers", hover over "Register", and click "Server..."

2. Give it a name; I call mine "Local".

3. Click on the tab called "Connection".

4. Ensure that the following details are correct:
   - Host name/address is 'db'
   - Port is '5432'
   - Database is 'nordic_bank'
   - Username is 'hansen'
   - Password is 'secret'
   Remember to toggle "Save password?".

5. Click Save, and you can now see the schemas that have been created.

## Conclusion

You have now set up the Nordic Bank application locally. For further instructions, refer to the project's documentation.
